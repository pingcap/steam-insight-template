This game dataset stands for [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)'s data. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset) offers two types of data, [CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset?select=games.csv) and [Json](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset?select=games.json).

But the data organized way is the document model. We need to transcript it to the relational model.

When I analyzed it, I found CSV format lacked a lot of information. So the final way is:

- Using Python to read Json data, using [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/type_basics.html) to create and save the data model. This data model is raw type, which means we store the list, map, and struct as the varchar type in the database.
- Then, try to follow the [third normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form) (3NF) to expand the many-to-many relationship
- Clean the table

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout
    headerProps={{
      title: "Background",
    }}
    markdown
  >
    {children}
  </Layout>
);
